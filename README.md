## Overview

This project explore the coverage of sexual assault cases by Israeli media outlet, in an effort to highlight problematic practices by evaluting stories against the best practices put forward by Kulan/כולן, an Israeli feminist group, and pave a way for stronger condemnation of perpetrators and support of survivors.

## Project Motivation
In the past several months, Israel has been going through an epidemic of severe sexual assault cases, domestic violence incidents associated with the long-lasting lockdown measures, and absurdly lenient verdicts for convicted sexual offenders. While there surely have been many such cases earlier, public awareness, reaction, and media coverage in relation to recents events has been heightened. 

Kulan (the feminine version of the word ‘everyone’ in Hebrew), a feminist activist group, has recently launced an online campign named Fair Coverage, aiming to eradicate prevalent reporting practices that perpetuate ‘rape culture’. Such practices include victim-blaming, disproportionately highlighting the perpetrator’s lawyers, and focusing attention on the consequences on the offenders career or life trajectory while downplaying the victim’s voice and harm. A key part of the campaign is devoted to calling out media articles from online news platforms. So far, this happened sporadically and reactively, partly due to the organization’s limited resources. This project is intended to support Kulan’s endeavor by applying NLP, text analysis, and machine learning techniques to evaluate sexual assault media coverage in Israeli media outlets. For scoping purposes, I looked at articles from four years on Walla! News. 

## Current Status, December 18th, 2020 + How to Navigate

This is still a work in progress. The code for scraping, analyzing, and visualizing the data is all contained in one Jupyter notebook, 'kulan.ipynb'. The code for topic modeling, a small section of the analysis, is in its respective notebook. The data files are saved as [Pickles](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) in the data folder, and you can get what is what by reading the notebook (it's pretty organized). 

The PDF is a hybrid between a reflection and presentation of the process and findings I made up to this point, submitted as part of a Digital Humanities course at Minerva. Hopefully, a more friendly public-facing version will be available soon.

I'm at tom.kremer@minerva.kgi.edu if this interested, intrigued, or upset you.
